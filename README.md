# SCT_ML_3
This code uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. The images are first preprocessed by scaling and resizing, and then features are extracted from the images. The SVM model is trained on the extracted features and labels, and then used to make predictions on the test set.
